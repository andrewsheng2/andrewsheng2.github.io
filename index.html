                </header>
                <p>I am currently residing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and am a current second-year computer science student
                   studying at Carnegie Mellon University, but I am from Brooklyn, New York. I am primarily focused on artificial
                   intelligence and machine learning, and am planning on pursuing a machine learning concentration and physics minor. I
                   primarily code in Python, C, and SML/NJ but am interested in other languages such as React.js.</p>
                <p>I am also passionate about audio engineering, and am currently a part of AB Tech, an organization that provides
                   sound and lighting support to many events at Carnegie Mellon. I am primarily a sound engineer, but am also interested in
                   lighting design, and various other positions in entertainment technology. See the top of this website for some of the
                   shows that I have worked on!</p>

            <p>AB Tech is a student organization at Carnegie Mellon University that provides professional-grade sound and lighting support
               for many events around campus. I usually serve as a sound engineer for many events, where I ensure that we use the correct
               selection of microphones and speakers for the best audience listening experience, but I occasionally also serve as a
               production manager, where I communicate with organizers to make sure we meet their technical needs, to help plan what
               positions are needed for the show, and to set deadlines for crucial information such as set lists. I also serve as the Assistant
               Personnel Manager for the organization, where I facilitated smooth operation of the organization by ensuring all events
               have enough people assigned to work on them.

            </header>
            <p>CPC Beacon is a nonprofit organization in Brooklyn, NY that provides education for lower-income and immigrant families.
               During the summers of 2018 and 2019, I served as a youth worker for the organization, where I led lessons primarily in science
               and math. For example, I introduced and got students interested in computer science by teaching engaging lessons involving
               computer graphics. I also developed a point system implemented using Python to encourage students to participate in classroom
               activities and to show a real-world use of computer science. In addition to teaching lessons, I was also involved with the camp's
               annual summer showcase, running the sound system during the showcase as well as communicating and assisting most classes with audio
               editing to make sure the showcase ran smoothly and professionally.

            <p>Throughout my Artificial Intelligence course (15-281), I have programmed many different algorithms
               to solve games of Pacman. These include algorithms such as A*, Integer and Linear Programming,
               Logical Planning, Reinforcement Learning, as well as making heuristics to make these some of these
               algorithms more efficient.

            </header>
            <p>As a term project in my programming class (15-112), I developed a game based on the popular mobile game
               Super Hexagon. In addition to recreating the original game in Python, I added many more features to make
               a more enjoyable experience. These include multiplayer so people can compete against each other, as well
               as the option to dynamically create obstacles to the beat of a user uploaded song.

            <p>At a hackathon, a group of friends and I decided to make a Python program based on the Coup card game.
               I was primarily responsible for creating the user interface and the multiplayer aspect of the game,
               and this was the first time that I had done so.
